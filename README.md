# Analyze-09443b0c

This repository contains a small data processing script intended to be run in CI and published via GitHub Pages.

What is included
- execute.py — Python 3.11+ script that reads data.csv and writes result.json
- data.csv — CSV converted from the provided data.xlsx
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — GitHub Actions workflow that lints with ruff, runs the script, and publishes result.json to GitHub Pages

Usage
- Locally:
  - Ensure Python 3.11+ and pandas 2.3 are installed:
    pip install pandas==2.3.0 openpyxl
  - Run:
    python execute.py
  - This will produce result.json

- CI:
  - On push to main, the workflow runs ruff, executes execute.py, and publishes result.json to GitHub Pages.

Notes
- Do not commit result.json — it is generated in CI and published to Pages.
- The CSV was produced from the provided Excel attachment and included here as data.csv for easy execution.

Commit message for this change is included in the repository as well.
